## Introduction

TrackBloom ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our habit and task tracking application ("TrackBloom" or "the App") handles your information.

## Our Privacy Commitment

TrackBloom is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your personal data should remain under your control.

## Information We Collect

### No Personal Information Collection

- **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your device and is not synchronized with any cloud services.
- **Complete Control**: You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time by uninstalling the app.

## How We Use Information

### No Data Processing
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not process, analyze, or use your data in any way.

### Local Functionality
- Your habits and tasks are processed locally on your device to provide the app's core functionality.
- Progress calculations, streak tracking, and analytics are performed entirely on your device.
- No data is sent to external servers for processing.

## Information Sharing

### No Data Sharing
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not share, sell, or rent your information to any third parties.

- Access to your data is limited to the TrackBloom app only.
- No external access to your data is possible.

### Your Responsibility
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device.
- We recommend using device-level security features like screen locks and encryption.

## Data Retention

### Local Retention
- Your data remains on your device as long as you have the app installed.
- When you uninstall TrackBloom, all your data is permanently deleted from your device.
- We do not retain any copies of your data after app uninstallation.

## Your Rights

## Children's Privacy

TrackBloom does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, this app is safe for users of all ages.

## International Users

Since TrackBloom operates entirely offline and does not collect or process any data, international data transfer regulations do not apply to our service.

## Data Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting TrackBloom, we would notify users through app updates and our website. However, since we do not store any data on our servers, the risk of a data breach is minimal.

## Third-Party Services

TrackBloom does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or external data sources. The app operates completely independently.

## App Permissions

TrackBloom may request the following device permissions:
- **Storage**: To save your habits and tasks locally on your device
- **Notifications**: To send local reminders (if implemented in future versions)

These permissions are used only for local functionality and do not involve data transmission.

## Conclusion

TrackBloom is designed to respect your privacy by keeping all your data local and under your control. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, and our app reflects this commitment through its offline-first design and zero data collection approach.

By using TrackBloom, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.
